   <h2>Definition of Neko<h2>

<h5>Neko is the Japanese word for cat. It can refer to actual cats or to characters
    in anime or manga that have catlike features. Specifically, the catgirl (a woman
    with cat ears, whiskers, and sometimes paws or a tail) is referred to as a neko.</h5>

<h2>Basic information on Neko</h2>

<p>A nekomimi,or neko for short,is a half human,half cat person,with cat ears,a cat tail
   and sometimes claws and fangs</p>

<h2>The appearance of a neko</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ears:A neko`s ears would be where their human ears are and sort of tilt diagonally,
         though they can move freely</li>
<li>Tail:The tail is located at the lower area,where the tailbone would be</li>
<li>Claws and Fangs:Their claws are their nails nd their fangs are their teeth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How long will it take to become a neko?</h2>
<p>the process in becoming a neko takes about 1 year,maximum 2

   The reason it takes so long is because it takes time for all the muscles and bones
   to grow.Bones,muscles,and fur cannot automatically grow</p>

<h2>Things neko`s do to stay healthy</h2>
<ol>
<li>They make sure they dont use their ears or tail when they have just finished
    their growth as their new body parts need time to adjust</li>
<li>They eat what cats would eat as it helps ensure their health</li>
<li>They dont wear earings during ear growth as it disrupts the growth of the ears</li>
</ol>

<h2>Myths on neko`s</h2>
<p>These myths do not follow any information,like the appearance etc.</p>

<h3>neko`s have retractable cat ears,tails,and claws</h3>
<p>this is false as their ears have nowhere to go,the tail cannot just lose all those
   tiny bones,muscles and ligaments,if the claws retracted,you would have no nails and
   if the fangs retracted,you would have no teeth.</p>

<h3>neko`s ears are on top of the head</h3>
<p>This is mostly false as the human ears are the only place where ear canals even are.
   You CANNOT grow another pair of ear canals on the top of the head as they would
   not be able to hear</p>

<p>The information above shows info on neko`s using researched details.Hope it was
   helpful</p>
